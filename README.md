# Welcome to My GitHub Profile 👋

Hi, I'm Jeffrey Kleykamp 👨‍🔬 / 👩‍💻. I'm a computational physicist with a focus on neutrino physics, passionate about solving complex problems through data analysis and machine learning. Currently, I’m a postdoc working on the Nova and DUNE experiments, where I manage large-scale datasets and distributed computing environments. While the majority of my work is nonpublic, I’m actively exploring opportunities to transition into a data science role, leveraging my skills in Python, C++, SQL, and TensorFlow.
